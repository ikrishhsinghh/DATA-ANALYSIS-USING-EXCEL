Project Title:
Step into Data Analysis — Exploring Excel for Real-World Insights

Description:
I recently took my first step into the world of Data Analysis, starting with Excel as my foundation tool.
This GitHub repository showcases my learning journey so far.
It’s divided into two main sections:
- BASIC COMMANDS – Here, I experimented with new Excel functions, formulas, and operations. It’s a collection of my practice files that reflect what I’ve learned—everything from cleaning data to performing initial mathematical operations.
- PROPER PROJECT – This section includes a complete data analysis project. It covers data cleaning, visualization, mathematical calculations, and dashboard creation to generate insights from raw data.

This marks my first step toward mastering the analytical mindset—transforming data into stories and insights.
